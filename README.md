<h1>Welcome To My Portifolio </h1>

<h3>Here i will explain what i have done and how</h3>

<p>Intially i thought about how i would like the lay out of the website to be.<br>
I discored online a good amount of sites that have a load of content such as color pallets, simple css templates and website tutorials.
<br>
After my reaserch i decided to start cooding. I got to admit i got a bit excited and did a lot without commiting the files into Github.
  Once i realised that the commits were important for the project i re-made my whole file page and started copying and pasting allowing for me to commit files in between sections.
</p>
<p>
  If you feel like the commits are a bit out of place with the progress of the website please get in touch with me and i will explain the parts better.</p>
  <p>
    Having that in mind i know in what i have to work on. Cooding is not just about me but also other people that will be using and sharing the project.</p>
    <p>
      As always a good learning curve and i garantee it won't happen again. 
    </p>
