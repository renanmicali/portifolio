                    <p class="section_text_p1">This was my first real-world project. Although I had my concerns about creating a website saying that I was a web developer I thought it was a great way to start my journey.
                        <br>To be completely honest I cannot say that I have built it myself. I used a lot of the tutorial guide and basically just coded along with the video mentor.
                        Not the best way to learn I have to admit but it just gave me an idea of what if possible you can actually code. Having some experience with WordPress I can say that knowing CSS, HTML, and JavaScript can open new doors for really amazing designs.
                        <br>How this website resulted made me realize that code is not impossible, it is logical and the only thing that I had to do was to change my way of thinking. This is the moment that made me start my journey, not just a journey to change my career, but a journey to change my way of thinking and showed me that I can do hard things.</p>
